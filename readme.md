# A simple project to mimic the components of a CHIP-8 in the form of an emulator.
This emulator is designed to fortify my understanding of how a CPU works. The excercise works through a dissassembler, instruction set and display objects. a tokenizer, parser, code generator and virtual machine. Most of which are principles of OS.

To build this project, simply clone this project and then compile it as follows:
````
make all
````
To run the emulator
````
bin/chip8-emulator.o
````
To run the tests
````
bin/test.o
````
